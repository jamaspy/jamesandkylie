                Welcome to our little wedding space on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back in 2020 we had this little plan to get married.

            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">We also had this same little plan in mid 2021, AND early 2022.... alas the universe saw
                it fit to scupper those plan 3 times over! </p>

            <p className="mt-4 font-semibold mb-2">However, we are pleased to announce our wedding 3.0 ðŸ¥³ </p>
            <p> Kylie & I are super excited to finally be able to share this special day with you all in the Hunter
                Valley, NSW. We spent many (many) long weekends here enjoying the amazing landscapes and the equally
                amazing wineries. AND it is where I asked Kylie to marry me.</p>

            <p className="mt-4">This small website aims to give you all the details for the day, as well as a way to
                RSVP. We have added
                some details around accomodation in the Hunter as well as outline what will be going on in the days
                running up to the wedding that we would love you all to get involved in.</p>

                through a WhatsApp
